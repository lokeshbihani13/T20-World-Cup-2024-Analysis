Travis Head,Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"He had made his Sheffield Shield debut at the age of 18 in the 2011-12 season and over the next few summers he established his place in the South Australia batting line-up and was a consistent contributor. In February 2015, Head became their youngest captain at the age of 21. He had been viewed as a future leader ever since he captained South Australia to the Under-19 National Championship title in 2012-13 and was named Player of the Championship. As captain of South Australia he showed maturity beyond his years, and in 2015-16 steered them to their first Sheffield Shield final in 20 years."

Shoaib Khan,Oman,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,
Glenn Maxwell,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"In 2017 he made his first Test hundred, against India in Ranchi. He was subsequently briefly dropped from the ODI side but came back and made his third T20I century in Bangalore early in 2019 to help Australia chase 191. The ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE that followed was a high point as well."
Kaleemullah,Oman,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Since then, he has become an effective and sometimes devastating presence in the Oman bowling attack. Kaleemullah has a reputation as a rhythm bowler who uses his height and bounce to unsettle opposing batters. His best success has come in lengthy new-ball spells probing away with line and length, whether it is bowling four straight overs in T20 cricket or seven to eight overs in ODIs. He was a key member of the bowling unit that helped take Oman to ODI status in 2019 and has remained a steady wicket-taker in the years since.
"
Josh Hazlewood,Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Hazlewood grew up with Glenn McGrath as his idol and was handed a rookie state contract for 2008-09, despite still being in year 12 in Tamworth, in country New South Wales. At the time, he had not even played a game for a Sydney grade club. But the observers who had seen something in Hazlewood were to be justified, as he statistically kept pace with McGrath, or near enough to it, during the early stages of his international career. Both men had made their Test debuts at 23 and Hazlewood reached 100 Test wickets in 46 innings, just one innings slower than his idol."
Bilal Khan,Oman,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Bilal's pace is a couple of notches under express but his sharp inswing can be a handful for Associate batters not used to such skill at those speeds with the new ball. Far more deadly are his spells bowling at the death, which feature a devastating reverse-swinging yorker. Hong Kong found out the hard way in an elimination match at the 2019 T20 World Cup Qualifier in Dubai in a spell that helped Oman clinch a return trip to the T20 World Cup. "

Zeeshan Maqsood,Oman,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,
David Warner,Australia,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Opening Batter,"He returned for the 2019 World Cup and enjoyed a prolific tournament before suffering a record-breakingly poor Ashes, in which he made 95 runs in ten innings. He bounced back later that year with an unbeaten 335 against Pakistan in Adelaide - the second-highest Test score by an Australian - during a home summer in which he received the Allan Border Medal."
Shakeel Ahmed,Oman,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Nathan Ellis,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,He forced his way into the Tasmania set up and in 2020-21 enjoyed a breakout BBL campaign for Hobart Hurricanes. By the middle of 2021 he was on Australia duty and on his T20I debut against Bangladesh in Mirpur claimed a hat-trick. A few months later he picked up an IPL deal with Punjab Kings and was a reserve in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup squad.
Shakeel Ahmed,Oman,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Mitchell Marsh,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"Mitchell Marsh, one of the most well-known surnames in Australian cricket, had been an alluring prospect for many years but struggled to cement a place across formats. However, that has changed in recent years, starting in T20 and then taking in ODIs and, perhaps most significantly, Test cricket."

Mitchell Starc,Australia,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."
Adam Zampa,Australia,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler,"He took five wickets at an economy of 6.27 in the 2016 T20 World Cup, and a six-for in the IPL that followed, but it took Zampa a while to cement his place in the Australian ODI and T20I teams. "
Marcus Stoinis,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"A powerful, versatile batter and medium-pace bowler, Marcus Stoinis has been a mainstay in Australia's limited-overs sides, a dominant presence in the BBL, and a sought-after IPL performer. "

Hardik Pandya,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,Allrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball. 
Rishabh Pant,India,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team."
Hardik Pandya,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,Allrounder Hardik Pandya's calling cards brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking marked by the ability to hit sixes from the first ball. 
Rohit Sharma,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20."
Shivam Dube,India,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,- Shivam Dube started his IPL career in 2019 after Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) bought him for INR 5 crore.
Kuldeep Yadav,India,Left hand Bat,Left arm Wrist spin,Bowler,"Kuldeep Yadav started as a fast bowler when he first joined a cricket academy in Kanpur, but was asked by his coach Kapil Pandey to switch to something much rarer - left-arm wristspin. The change wasn't smooth - Kuldeep admitted that he had even tried once - but he soon realised bowling left-arm wristspin was the way forward for him. And he was good at it too, having not only solid control over the length, but also a potent wrong'un among his variations."
Ravindra Jadeja,India,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling."
Jasprit Bumrah,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him. "
Pat Cummins,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances. By 2023 he had led the team to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup."
Axar Patel,India,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58."
Suryakumar Yadav,India,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. He also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140."
Haris Rauf,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,
Virat Kohli,India,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them."
Ravindra Jadeja,India,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Dissed when he first appeared, Ravindra Jadeja won the doubters and haters over with his deeds, and now sits among the elite of Indian spin bowling."
Matthew Wade,Australia,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"He moved from Hobart to Melbourne when he realised he would be stuck behind Tim Paine in the Tasmania wicketkeeping queue. Victoria gave him a chance and he grabbed it, making 83 and taking six catches on his first-class debut. Wade would later become a Sheffield Shield-winning captain for Victoria, leading them to two titles in their hat-trick of wins between 2015 and 2017."
Pat Cummins,Australia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Earmarked as a potential star from a young age, Pat Cummins made his Test debut as an 18-year-old but had to wait six years for his next appearance as injuries struck a body that could not withstand the workload. The bowler who emerged in 2017 was a thoroughbred quick who became one of the standout players in the world and, in late 2021, Australia's Test captain in dramatic circumstances. By 2023 he had led the team to the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup."
Harmeet Singh,U.S.A.,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"After the 2013 IPL spot-fixing controversy broke, a bookie had alleged that he had tried to get Harmeet involved but didn't strike a deal as the player was too young. Harmeet was subsequently investigated by the BCCI, but cleared of any wrongdoing."
Nitish Kumar,U.S.A.,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,
Iftikhar Ahmed,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Two games on from that Karachi ODI against New Zealand, he made his first hundred in the format, in a partnership of 214 runs with Babar Azam against Nepal in the Asia Cup, and chased it up with a 47 against Sri Lanka later in the tournament. That fetched him a place in the side that went to India for the World Cup - where he did not do much of note, much like the Pakistan side as a whole."
Haris Rauf,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,
Mohammad Rizwan,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,"On the domestic circuit, Rizwan has been a prolific run-accumulator, averaging a shade under 50 in List A cricket and 41 at first-class level. He doesn't, however, seem to have the shots necessary to make him a valuable asset in T20Is, but with that being Sarfaraz's strongest suit, both as a batsman and captain, it would have been hard to dislodge him in the format at any rate. "
Corey Anderson,U.S.A.,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Anderson made his first-class debut in 2007, but had to wait till 2012 for his maiden first-class century. It was a big hundred, though - 167 against Otago - and soon after that he was included in New Zealand's squad for the Twenty20 international series in South Africa. He didn't do much in that series, and was injured for the subsequent one-dayers - a continuation of fitness issues that have followed him through the early part of his career - but continued to score runs in the domestic season. In 2013, he was included in New Zealand's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy, and made his debut in that format against England in Cardiff."
Shaheen Shah Afridi,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"He burst into the nation's consciousness with 8 for 39 on Quaid-e-Azam Trophy debut, the best-ever figures by a debutant in the competition. Later, he was picked for the PSL, where figures of five wickets for four runs in a group game for Lahore Qalandars won him a place in the T20I squad against the West Indies. "

Mohammad Amir,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"He hovered in the high 80mphs, touching even 90 on occasion and was a crucial opening link in Pakistan's title run. He bowled several nerveless final overs and one absolutely crucial opening over, in the final, when he dismissed tournament top-scorer Tillakaratne Dilshan for a five-ball duck, peppering him with quick, short balls. He carried his form over to the ODI version, picking up match-winning figures of 4 for 28 against Sri Lanka in August before turning in consistent spells in the Champions Trophy. "
Fakhar Zaman,Pakistan,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,"His first three T20Is only brought him 26 runs, and much of the world was still unaware of his talent when he made his ODI debut a couple of months later, in England, during the 2017 Champions Trophy. Having missed the opening-match defeat to India, Zaman turned Pakistan's batting fortunes around with scores of 31, 50, 57 and 114 in his first four ODI innings, his strike rate of 113.00 giving a dated 50-overs line-up much-needed oomph at the top of the order. The maiden hundred went on to win him the Player-of-the-Match award in the final, setting up a total of 338 that proved a long way beyond India's reach.Danyal Rasool"
Ali Khan,U.S.A.,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"On his CPL debut, Khan dismissed Kumar Sangakkara with his first delivery. He became an American citizen and was finally selected in a USA squad for the first time for the 2016 Auty Cup and ICC WCL Division Four in Los Angeles."
Jasdeep Singh,U.S.A.,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"After bouncing in and out of the USA squad over the subsequent two years, he suffered torn ligaments in his right knee while fielding on the boundary in a warm-up match at Los Angeles in the spring of 2017 ahead of WCL Division Three in Uganda. The severity of the injury was not known at the time and Jessy played through pain in Uganda to take the match-clinching wicket against the hosts that helped USA avoid relegation. He had reconstructive knee surgery upon returning home and spent more than a year rehabilitating his knee before breaking back into the USA squad for the CWI Super50 tournament at Barbados in October 2018.

Babar Azam,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"""We didn't have to guide him, he was on his own, but we were supportive all the way,"" Kamran Akmal said. Azam had the distinction of top scoring regularly in age-group domestic cricket before he was called up to the national side in 2015 and made his debut during the home ODI series against Zimbabwe - a rarity because Azam's rise was during Pakistan's isolation as an international venue due to security concerns. "
Naseem Shah,Pakistan,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Bodies that young don't often have to handle the force required to generate that sort of speed, and what followed was a spate of injuries that initially impacted his performance before sidelining him for more than a year. It wasn't until the third Test against Australia in Lahore in March 2022 that Naseem returned to the international fold. Mercifully, the pace was still extreme and there were no signs of the injuries he had nursed during his time away."

Archer was the most prolific England bowler, taking 20 wickets over a gruelling six-week tournament, and was entrusted with bowling the most important over in England's limited-overs history in the final at Lord's. New Zealand needed 7 off 4 to claim the trophy after Jimmy Neesham heaved the second legitimate ball of Archer's Super Over for six, but he held his nerve. Martin Guptill was run out attempting a second run off his final delivery, a leg-stump yorker, and Archer charged towards the Tavern Stand in celebration."
Moeen Ali,Info,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"He was also a 50-over World Cup winner, as well as a regular at the IPL - his flair for fast scoring and utility as an allrounder encouraging the decision to focus solely on white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup in the UAE. Moeen admitted that he felt his batting had been ""wasted"" in Test cricket, where he featured everywhere from No. 1 to No. 9, but there will still moments to treasure, from an unbeaten hundred in his second Test to four centuries in the calendar year in 2016."

Still a Durham academy youngster, he hit 87 in a fine debut for Scotland against Ireland in Dubai as his more experienced team-mates toiled. That breakthrough was followed by a first-team debut against Derbyshire at Chesterfield in June of that year.

He lost his place in the ODI squad in 2016, but was impressive in the World T20 in India that year: but for Carlos Brathwaite's last-gasp heroics, the fact he went for only eight runs in the 19th over of the final would surely have been remembered more fondly."

He needed stitches but Pietersen left him a signed bat as a more welcome memento."
Michael van Lingen,Namibia,Left hand Bat,"Left arm Medium, Slow Left arm Orthodox",Bowling Allrounder,
Moeen Ali,England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"He was also a 50-over World Cup winner, as well as a regular at the IPL - his flair for fast scoring and utility as an allrounder encouraging the decision to focus solely on white-ball cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup in the UAE. Moeen admitted that he felt his batting had been ""wasted"" in Test cricket, where he featured everywhere from No. 1 to No. 9, but there will still moments to treasure, from an unbeaten hundred in his second Test to four centuries in the calendar year in 2016."
Jos Buttler,England,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"England have had many players down the ages who have gained world acclaim, but Jos Buttler is arguably their first global Twenty20 superstar. Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai. He has also shone at the IPL, and quickly became a senior player in the Test side since his surprise recall in 2018."
Chris Jordan,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"He played only twice in the ignominious 2015 World Cup, but had shown enough promise in an England shirt to survive the cull following that tournament. He lost his place in the ODI squad in 2016, but was impressive in the World T20 in India that year: but for Carlos Brathwaite's last-gasp heroics, the fact he went for only eight runs in the 19th over of the final would surely have been remembered more fondly."
Liam Livingstone,England,Right hand Bat,"Right arm Offbreak, Legbreak",Batting Allrounder,"By the time he topped the run-scorers' table at the inaugural Hundred in 2021 with 348 runs from nine games, Livingstone was something of a seasoned T20 campaigner, with experience in the PSL, IPL, BBL, and South Africa's Mzansi Super League. He was also one of MI Cape Town's early signings in the SA20 two years on."
Sam Curran,England,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Punjab Kings subsequently made him the most expensive buy at an IPL auction, outbidding five other teams to acquire his services for INR 18.50 crore (Â£1.85 million approximately). Back in 2018, the same franchise - Kings XI Pubjab, as they were known at the time - purchased him for INR 7.2 crore (Â£800,000 approximately). It was at the IPL, while playing for Chennai Super Kings, he showed his dexterity as a makeshift opening batter, having primarily been used as a hitter down the order. "
Harry Brook,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"A former England U19s captain, Brook had flickered in Yorkshire colours over the first couple of years of his professional career, most notably when scoring a maiden first-class hundred at Chelmsford in 2018, as the visitors recovered from being bowled out for 50 in their first innings to inflict defeat on reigning champions Essex. He recorded a List A hundred at the start of Yorkshire's 2019 Royal London Cup campaign, and showed signs of greater consistency the following summer when he averaged 43.00 in the Bob Willis Trophy."
David Wiese,Namibia,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"An imposing allrounder, with the skills to take pace off the ball, and a strong lofted drive, Wiese was a late bloomer who came to prominence in the shorter formats.

It was Mendis' excellent returns in the Moin-ud-Dowlah three-day tournament in Hyderabad that paved his route to the national team.

His first Test hundred was 149 against New Zealand in Hamilton; in that innings, he and Mahmudullah put on a 235-run partnership, helping Bangladesh save face after New Zealand racked up 715. In ODIs, Soumya starred with a hundred and three fifties (two of them big) during Bangladesh's golden run in 2015 when they won three series in a row, against Pakistan, India and South Africa. Four years later, his batting was to the fore again - three fifties on the trot - in Bangladesh's title win in a tri-series against West Indies and Ireland in Malahide.
"
Tanzid Hasan,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,,Opening Batter,
Najmul Hossain Shanto,Bangladesh,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"In May that year, he made his first ODI century, in a narrow win over Ireland. A month later he got his first Test hundreds at home - a twin effort in a massive victory over Afghanistan in Mirpur, following it up with a controlled, clinical hundred against a patient New Zealand attack in Bangladesh's next Test.
He went into the ODI World Cup having scored a half-century and a hundred in successive Asia Cup matches and kicked off the global tournament with two more 50-plus scores. Although a string of single-digit scores followed, Shanto broke the rut in style with a match-winning 90 in the infamous timed-out match against Sri Lanka - where it was he who pointed out to captain Shakib Al Hasan that Bangladesh had the right to appeal against Angelo Matthews for taking too long to face his first ball. 
In his first major series as the long-term captain, against Sri Lanka at home in 2024, Shanto led Bangladesh to a 2-1 win in ODIs at home over Sri Lanka, but lost the T20I and Test series. Ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup, Bangladesh lost a series to USA as well."
Rashid Khan,Afghanistan,Right hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowling Allrounder,"Rashid Khan has been Afghanistan's first global superstar, and the key to their successes in their early years in international cricket. His extraordinarily effective legspin has made him one of the greatest T20 bowlers ever, among the first names on wishlists of teams in leagues all around the world. "
Mahmudullah,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"He made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2007 and was labeled a limited-overs specialist for some time and he delivered in short bursts, hardly setting the world on fire. But his eight-wicket haul on Test debut (including a five-for in the second innings) against West Indies in 2009 spurred him on as he suddenly averaged 193 with the bat in the ODI tri-series against India and Sri Lanka later that year."
Litton Das,Bangladesh,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A compact batter with a good defence and flair, Litton made 44 in his first Test, against India in Fatullah in mid-2015, and followed that up with a fifty that helped fetch a first-innings lead against South Africa in Chattogram. In Bloemfontein two years on, he top-scored for Bangladesh with 70 after the home side racked up a massive total. He made 94 against Sri Lanka in the match after that, but his first Test hundred took nearly another four years to materialise, coming late in 2021 against Pakistan, in Chattogram again. He top-scored in the second innings of that game too, with 59, but Pakistan won thanks to a feeble performance by the other Bangladesh batters. That match came near the start of a nine-Test purple patch, spanning about 11 months running from mid-2021, in which Litton averaged a little under 60, making three hundreds and five fifties, including 102 after Bangladesh followed on in Christchurch."

He was talent-spotted by Lahore Qalandars, who invited him to play in the Abu Dhabi T20 trophy - a Champions League-lite - but Islamabad United swooped to sign him in the PSL draft instead. "

Maharaj debuted at the WACA, an unusual place for a spinner, given the conditions, but did a remarkable job. In an innings in which he had to hold one end when Dale Steyn was injured, Maharaj bowled well enough to allow the other two seamers to be rotated at the other side. He took 3 for 56 in the first innings, four in the match, and scored an unbeaten 41 to show great promise for the future."
Quinton de Kock,South Africa,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Quinton de Kock's fearless striking and handy glovework earned him comparisons to greats of the game like Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher early in his career.

His first season with Colts Cricket Club was modest, but his second was good, and his third outstanding. Samarawickrama topped Tier-A run charts with 1016 runs at 59.76 in the 2016-17 season.

Since then, he hasn't looked back, making three fifties in Jamaica in an ODI series win over West Indies to start 2022. That run came in a stretch of nine ODI innings where he made seven scores of over 50, the last two of them hundreds against New Zealand.

Although he has been troubled by a back injury, which has limited his ability to bowl, Stirling is also a highly competent back-up offspinner. He has frequently bowled his full allocation of overs for Ireland in ODIs and, with 1-45 from ten overs, was Ireland's most economical bowled during their victory over England in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup."
Lorcan Tucker,Ireland,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"In the T20 World Cup in 2022, Tucker was Ireland's top scorer. He made 71 not out against Australia in an innings where his team's next-highest score was 14, an unbeaten 45 in an impressive chase against West Indies that Ireland won, and 34 to set England a target that they failed to reach."
Curtis Campher,Ireland,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Campher, a diminutive seam-bowling allrounder, has ambitions to move up the order and bat in the top six. He moved to Munster Reds ahead of the 2021 domestic season after playing for Leinster Lightning in his first summer as an adopted Irishman, though ankle surgery provided a setback. It was Niall O'Brien, the long-standing Ireland wicketkeeper, who first discovered that Campher qualified - thanks to his grandmother, who was brought up in Derry - while chatting to him during a warm-up match for the 2019 World Cup Qualifier."

Charles' knock helped West Indies secure their first win over Australia in any format for 16 years. Charles hit a century as well in the fifth ODI on that Australian tour, having elbowed way into the West Indies ODI team in 2012 with a string of startling displays for the Windward Islands in the Caribbean Twenty20 tournament."
Rovman Powell,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Middle order Batter,"He has been a consistent performer for Jamaica in white-ball cricket, with runs from the middle order, and captained the Tallawahs franchise in the 2020 CPL.

Gudakesh Motie,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"One of many Guyanese cricketers of Indian heritage, Gudakesh Motie is a tall left-arm spinner who, despite a short international career so far, has become West Indies' primary spinner across formats. Outside his home island of Guyana, Motie's name first came up during the 2014 Under-19 World Cup. He didn't set the stage alight, returning six wickets in six bowling innings at 34.83, but has built steadily since, as his numbers across formats show. First came a T20I debut, against Pakistan in Karachi in late 2021, and the Test and ODI debuts followed, at home against Bangladesh in mid-2022."
Nicholas Pooran,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Nicholas Pooran confirmed his status as one of the most exciting young batting talents in the modern game with a sublime innings of 118 off 103 in West Indies' defeat to Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup, but only four years earlier the idea that he would play international cricket seemed fanciful."

Brandon King,West Indies,Right hand Bat,,Top order Batter,"A step-up to the national squad seemed the natural order of things, but though King produced acceptable, if not earth-shattering performances in limited-overs series against Afghanistan, India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand, he was dropped from the side in late 2020. On his recall a year later, he scored fifties in T20Is against Pakistan and England, and an unbeaten 58 and 91 in an ODI series win against Netherlands.

Mark Watt,Scotland,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"When Scotland made a charge to the ODI World Cup Qualifiers in 2023, topping the table in the World Cricket League Division 2, Watt turned in crucial performances: in Aberdeen in 2022, he took 11 wickets in three games, against USA and UAE. He went a notch better in December that year and February 2023, when in seven games against Nepal and Namibia in Windhoek and Kirtipur, he took 20 wickets. Scotland ended up with 24 wins from their 36 games in the league. Watt played all but five of those ODIs, taking 54 wickets and finishing fourth on the WCL 2 wicket-takers' table for that cycle.

Having already bashed a 44-ball ton earlier in the tournament, Zazai's intimidation factor grew exponentially when he became the sixth batsman in competitive cricket, and third in T20s, to achieve the six sixes feat after carving up left-arm spinner Abdullah Mazari to put his name alongside Yuvraj Singh and Garry Sobers, among others, in the record books. Hidden in the euphoria of the six sixes was the fact that Zazai matched Yuvraj and Chris Gayle for the fastest fifty in all T20 cricket off 12 balls. "

There was speculation that the injury was a consequence of tinkering with his bowling action. So, under the supervision of one of his idols, Shane Bond, Boult reverted to the action he had used as a boy and the results were more than promising. By 2015, he was capable of long spells without wavering too far below the 140kph mark.

In a team that has been frequently loaded with quality frontline fast-bowling options, his presence has allowed Oman to leave one out in favour of an extra spinner when conditions have called for it without suffering much of a drop-off in pace quality.
