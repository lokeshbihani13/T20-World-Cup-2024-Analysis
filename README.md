2. Data Cleaning and Conversion: The extracted data, in JSON format, was cleaned and converted into CSV format using Python and the Pandas library.

3. Data Transformation and Cleaning: The CSV files were imported into Power BI, and data transformation and cleaning were performed using Power Query.

4. Data Visualization: The cleaned data was visualized using Power BI, and a dashboard was created to showcase the best players for the T20 World Cup 2024.
